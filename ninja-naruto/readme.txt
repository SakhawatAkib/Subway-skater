# INTRODUCTION, INSTALLATION, AND COMMENTS/SUGGESTIONS
##########

So, there aren't many Naruto fonts out (no other, to my knowledge at 
the time of this writing) there. I, realizing that, created my own! 
I call the masterpiece, Ninja Naruto! Yes, it's a Naruto font.

Ninja Naruto will not completely make Naruto text like the Naruto 
logo itself.

That would require some knowledge of the use of a graphics program 
such as GIMP, Adobe Photoshop, or Paint Shop Pro. Nonetheless, it 
gives you a base template on that all you need to add is a gradient 
fill, 2 borders, and a shadow. Should be simplistic.

As of now, this Ninja Naruto font is only available for Windows 
(sorry Mac and such users). It also only contains alphanumeric 
characters at the moment, and only uppercase (in the style in the 
actual Naruto title). Lastly, the letters N, A, R, U, T, and O are 
very similar to the original, but may differ a little, because I 
drew all the characters from scratch in Adobe Illustrator and 
assembled them in Font Creator.

You can install the font by going to the fonts folder (usually 
C:\WINDOWS\Fonts or C:\WINNT\Fonts) and going to File > Install 
New Font.

If you need a Photoshop tutorial on how to make the text look 
like the original, we have a similar tutorial, but it doesn't use 
the font, but insists on drawing the letters manually, mainly 
because the font didn't exist when the tutorial was created.
